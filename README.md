# American Options Pricing

This is a repo for American Options pricing. Usually the trading apps will give a Black-Scholes model output, which is only valid for European Options.

The core module contains C++ code for calculating the options pricing.

The service is written in Express.js, websocket and dockerized for easiness of development and use.
